# Blog
A modern, light-theme blog that uses MongoDB and Bootstrap styling.

## Get Started
```bash
git clone https://github.com/willuhm-js/Blog.git
# Edit src/config.js
npm install && npm start
```

## Tips for Usage
* Use &lt;br&gt; tags to seperate paragraphs; the first paragraph is used as the preview for each blog post. Try to keep the first paragraph between 2-5 sentences.
* Do not include an image in the first paragraph, use the thumbnail feature instead; thumbnails are rendered directly after the post title and tags.
